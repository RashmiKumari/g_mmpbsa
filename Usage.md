g_mmpbsa calculates binding energy of biomolecular associations like protein-protein, protein-ligand protein-DNA etc using MM-PBSA. It gives the different component of energy term in separate file so that user will have choice to have either MM, PB and SA energy values or all energies according to their objective. The tool also gives residue wise contribution to total binding energy which will provide information about important contributing residues to the molecular association.

This tool maps the binding energy contribution of each residue on the structure. The energy will be written in the B-factor field of the output PDB file/s. These PDB files can be used with any molecular visualizer and residues can be colored according to their energetic contribution. The molecular visualizer should support method to color residues by the B-factor values.
