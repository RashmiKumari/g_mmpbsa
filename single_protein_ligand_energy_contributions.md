#### Contribution of residues to the binding energy 

This tutorial is continuation of a [**previous tutorial**](single_protein_ligand_binding_energy.html). The required input files for this tutorial were generated in previous one.To calculate average contribution of the residues to the binding energy, a python script [**MmPbSaDecomp.py**](https://github.com/RashmiKumari/g_mmpbsa/blob/master/tools/MmPbSaDecomp.py){:target="_blank"} is provided. For details about this script, please click on this [**link**](Usage.html#mmpbsadecomppy).

    python MmPbSaDecomp.py -bs -nbs 2000 -m contrib_MM.dat -p contrib_pol.dat -a contrib_apol.dat
    
Two files `final_contrib_energy.dat` and `energyMapIn.dat` are obtained after executing the above command. `final_contrib_energy.dat` contains average with standard error (without bootstrap: standard deviation) values of the energy of contribution to all three energetic terms including binding energy for each residues. The contribution energy of residues could be plotted using file `energyMapIn.dat` with xmgrace/matplotlib/gnuplot, although value of last residue (inhibitor) should be removed during plotting. For example, a xmgrace format file is provided in `tutorial/1EBZ/output`.

#####  Visualization of contribution energy in VMD 

To visualize the contribution energy of residue with its structure, a PDB file containing energy values in B-factor field is required. This file could be generated using [**_energy2bfac_**](Usage.html#energy2bfac).

Execute _energy2bfac_ as following, select **1** and **13** group number for protein and ligand, respectively:

    energy2bfac -s 1EBZ_pbc_corrected.tpr -i energyMapIn.dat

Three files `complex.pdb`, `subunit_1.pdb` and `subunit_2.pdb` are obtained with default names. `subunit_1.pdb` and `subunit_2.pdb` are the PDB structure file for first and second group number, respectively. Now, load the PDB file in the VMD as follows:

    vmd  subunit_1.pdb

 Change graphical representation to `NewCartoon` in `Drawing Method`. Change `Coloring Method` to `Beta`. To get a color scale bar, go to `Extension` &#8658; `Visulaization` &#8658; `Color Scale Bar`. Choose `Autoscale: On`. Chose `Label format: Decimal`. Then, click on `Color Scale Bar`.

One could visualize the protein as shown in following figure in which residues with energy < -5.0 and energy > 5.0 are shown in licorice representation. This visualization state could be loaded in VMD as file is provided in `tutorial/1EBZ/output/contribution_energy.vmd`. Previously obtained `subunit_1.pdb` file should be present in the current directory. Open VMD, click on `File` &#8658; `Load Visualization State â€¦` and open the provided `contribution_energy.vmd` file.
