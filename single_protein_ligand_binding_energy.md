#### Download Tutorial Package 

 To download the tutorial package, click on this [**link**](tutorial.tar.gz). This package contains required file for the tutorial.

Untar this package by following command: 

    tar -zxvf tutorial.tar.gz
    cd tutorial
    cd 1EBZ

This directory contains topology-parameter (_tpr_), atom-index (_ndx_), and trajectory (_xtc_) files of  a HIV-1 protease inhibitor complex.


####  GMXLIB environment variable 

If GROMACS is installed at custom location, set the GMXLIB environment variable:

    export GMXLIB=/opt/gromacs/share/gromacs/top

####  Calculation of three energy componenets 

The binding energy consists of three energetic terms, (a) potential energy in vacuum, (b) polar-solvation energy and (c) non-polar solvation energy. These energetic terms could be calculated in either three or one step.

####  Three steps calculation 

**(a) Calculation of potential energy in Vacuum** 

Execute the following command, select **1** and **13** group number for protein and ligand, respectively:

    g_mmpbsa -f 1EBZ.xtc -s 1EBZ.tpr -n 1EBZ.ndx -pdie 2 -decomp

Two files `energy_MM.xvg` and `contrib_MM.dat` are generated as outputs. Both files could be generated with different name by `-mm filename1.xvg` and `-mmcon filename2.dat`. `energy_MM.xvg` file contains van der Waals, electrostatic interactions, and net non-bonded potential energy between the protein and inhibitor. `contrib_MM.dat` contains contribution of each residue to the calculated net non-bonded interaction energy.

**(b) Calculation of polar solvation energy** 

To calculate the polar solvation energy, an input file (e.g. tutorial/polar.mdp) is required. This file contains input parameters that are used in the calculation of polar solvation energy. To get the details of the input parameters, please click on this [**link**](Parameters.html).

Execute the following command, select **1** and **13** group number for protein and ligand, respectively:

    g_mmpbsa -f 1EBZ.xtc -s 1EBZ.tpr -n 1EBZ.ndx -i ../polar.mdp -nomme -pbsa -decomp

Two files `polar.xvg` and `contrib_pol.dat` are generated as outputs. Both files could be generated with different name by `-pol filename1.xvg` and `-pcon filename2.dat`.  `polar.xvg` contains polar solvation energies for unbound protein, unbound inhibitor and protein-inhibtor complex. `contrib_pol.dat` contains contribution of each residue to the calculated net polar solvation energy.

**(c) Calculation of non-polar solvation energy**

To calculate the non-polar solvation energy, an input file (e.g. tutorial/apolar_sasa.mdp) is required. This file contains parameters that are used in the calculation of non-polar solvation energy. To get the details of the input parameters, please click on this [**link**](Parameters.html). There are several type of non-polar models that are discussed in this [**publication**](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci500020m) (see Table 1 for values). Here, SASA-only and SAV-only model are used for which input parameter files are provided.

**For SASA-only model:**

Execute the following command, select **1** and **13** group number for protein and ligand, respectively:

g_mmpbsa -f 1EBZ.xtc -s 1EBZ.tpr -n 1EBZ.ndx -i ../apolar_sasa.mdp -nomme -pbsa -decomp -apol sasa.xvg -apcon sasa_contrib.dat`

Two files `sasa.xvg` and `sasa_contrib.dat` are generated as outputs. `sasa.xvg` contains non-polar solvation energy for unbound protein, unbound inhibitor and protein-inhibtor complex. `sasa_contrib.dat` contains contribution of each residue to the calculated net polar-solvation energy.

**For SAV-only model:**

Execute the following command, select **1** and **13** group number for protein and ligand, respectively:

g_mmpbsa -f 1EBZ.xtc -s 1EBZ.tpr -n 1EBZ.ndx -i ../apolar_sav.mdp -nomme -pbsa -decomp -apol sav.xvg -apcon sav_contrib.dat`

#### One step calculation

Execute the following command, select **1** and **13** group number for protein and ligand, respectively:

    g_mmpbsa -f 1EBZ.xtc -s 1EBZ.tpr -n 1EBZ.ndx -i ../pbsa.mdp -pdie 2 -pbsa -decomp`

`pbsa.mdp` contains input parameters for both polar and SASA-only non-polar solvation energies. All three energetic terms are calculated by using the above single command and all output files are generated.

#### Average Binding Energy Calculation

To calculate average binding energy, a python script [ **MmPbSaStat.py** ](https://github.com/RashmiKumari/g_mmpbsa/blob/master/tools/MmPbSaStat.py) is provided in the `g_mmpbsa` package. For details about this script, please click on this [**link**](Usage.html#mmpbsastatpy). To execute this script, above obtained files are required as the inputs.

To calculate average binding energy by direct method, execute following command:

    python MmPbSaStat.py -m energy_MM.xvg -p polar.xvg -a apolar.xvg (or sasa.xvg)

Two output files `full_energy.dat` and `summary_energy.dat` are obtained. `summary_energy.dat` contains average and standard deviations of all energetic components including the binding energy as follows:

    #Complex Number:    1 
    =============== 
       SUMMARY   
    =============== 

     van der Waal energy      =        -334.587   +/-   15.514 kJ/mol 

     Electrostattic energy    =        -159.380   +/-   15.810 kJ/mol 

     Polar solvation energy   =         313.698   +/-   10.174 kJ/mol 

     SASA energy              =         -30.431   +/-    0.996 kJ/mol 

     SAV energy               =           0.000   +/-    0.000 kJ/mol

    =============== 
        END     
    =============== 


`full_energy.dat` contains the values of energetic terms as a function of time. Last four columns contains  Δ_E_<sub>MM</sub>, Δ_G_<sub>polar</sub>, Δ_G_<sub>nonpolar</sub> and Δ_G_<sub>binding</sub> as a function of time. These quantities could be plotted with xmgrace/matplotlib/gnuplot. The respective four files in xmgrace format (_agr_) are provided in `tutorial/1EBZ/output`

<div class="result">

<img src="images\nonpolar_energy.png" height="220"/>
</div>

To calculate average binding energy by using bootstrap analysis, execute following command:

    python MmPbSaStat.py -bs -nbs 2000 -m energy_MM.xvg -p polar.xvg -a apolar.xvg (or sasa.xvg)

Again, two output files `full_energy.dat` and `summary_energy.dat` are genrated as outputs. `full_energy.dat` is similar to that of the above one. However, `summary_energy.dat` contains average and standard error of all energetic components including the binding energy.  Average values in `summary_energy.dat` are slightly different from the above one. For more details about this method, please follow this [**publication**](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci500020m).
